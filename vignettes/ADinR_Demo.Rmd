## Automatic Diferentiation in R
ADinR is a package that provides reverse-mode automatic differentiation in R.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r lib}
library(ADinR)
```

## Defining Parameters

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load}

adinr<-Rcpp::Module("adinr", PACKAGE="ADinR")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
